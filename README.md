Hello readers, i am Emyr, a current student at purwadhika, taking the data science & machine learning course. This file is a mandatory project for the completion of module 3, which focuses on Machine Learning using python.

This is a Jupyter Notebook file, analyzing a car insurance company's Customer Lifetime Value. Using the features available in the dataset, this project aims to create a regression model that can predict the Customer Lifetime Value of its customer. The project consists of data cleaning, data analysis, Modelling, Hyperparameter tuning, conclusions, and recomendations.

# CustomerLifetimeValue

Insurance is a means of protextion from finanncial loss. How insurance works is that the holder of the insurance ca npay a monthly premium, of which they can withdraw their insurance in times of need (usually after accidents). One of the most commonn insurance is car insurance.

However, as an insurance company, there comes a difficulty of determining the actual profit of selling insurance. that's where Customer Lifetime Value comes in. Customer Lifetime Value helps give an image of financial & investment returns from a customer, both in a short-term & long-term view.

with that i nmind, comes a need for insurance companies to have the ability to predict & determine every customer's 'Customer Lifetime Value' value.
